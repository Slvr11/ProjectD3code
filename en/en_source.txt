VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_INTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 As long as there are enough benefits, these people are willing to say anything.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_INTRO_05|^2 Soap: ^7 I went to investigate Cottes' case and see what's new.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_INTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 Great.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_INTRO_07|^2 Price: ^7 new, you follow the ghost to see Ortiz, and then bring the informant back.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_INTRO_08|^2 Price: ^7 Simple errands, young people - to help you warm up is appropriate.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_OUTRO_01|^2 Soap: ^7 Price, I'm soap.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_OUTRO_02|^2 soap: ^7 anti-Otiz people is Vazquez.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_OUTRO_03|^2 Soap: ^7 Vazquez is dirtier than we thought.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_OUTRO_04|^2 Soap: ^7 For nearly two months, he has been providing Cortes with military-grade weapons.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_OUTRO_05|^2 Ghost: ^7 Vazquez heard the wind - the bastard hid.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_OUTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 Vazquez actually sheltered Cotos Group and its partners, this is not good news.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_OUTRO_07|^2 Price: ^7 Ortiz and the newcomers are on a helicopter.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_OUTRO_08|^2 Price: ^7 Ortiz did not move too much, but he offered a small town called Audrand.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_OUTRO_09|^2 Price: ^7 The town is not far from your location, Vazquez is hiding here.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_FAVELA_OUTRO_10|^2 Price: ^7 We need you to sneak into his office to gather intelligence about his current location.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_CRASH_01|^2 Price: ^7 Vazquez used Audran as his temporary base of operations.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_CRASH_02|^2 Price: ^7 UAV will provide you with aerial surveillance.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_CRASH_03|^2 Price: ^7 Sneak into the town to Vazquez's office.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_CRASH_04|^2 Price: ^7 Find out the intelligence and find out his recent position and movement.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Vasquez previously worked with Cottes to remove unknown items from the country.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_INTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 Counterfeit money? arms?
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_INTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 Only Vazquez himself knows.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_INTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 We now know where he is hiding.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_INTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 Enter the place to capture Vazquez!
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Remove the Vazquez's mysterious organization armed to the teeth.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 Obviously they do not want to let us know what is going away from Juanito.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 Although Vazquez was annihilated, this operation was not without merit.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 Information obtained from a laptop reveals some disturbing information.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 Vazquez and Cottes shipped abroad as a chemical.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 called 115 elements.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_07|^2 Price: ^7 This is not good.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_08|^2 Price: ^7 Even worse, the preparations were shipped to Bacardi.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_09|^2 Price: ^7 Really bad.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_10|^2 Price: ^7 High-level and diplomatic personnel are trying to negotiate with the Bakar authorities.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_11|^2 Price: ^7 We try to see if we can find the whereabouts of 115 elements from the black market.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_12|^2 Price: ^7 In the meantime, new people, we'll send you to the chemical's shipping destination.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_ESTATE_OUTRO_13|^2 Price: ^7 You are doing well today - but your mission has just begun.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Bakar's diplomatic officials claim they have never had any contact with the Vazquez or Cautes groups.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_INTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 They also said that the 115-element factory was not in the Bakar state.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_INTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 but the "demilitarized zone" at the border between the two countries.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_INTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 Huck thinks it makes no sense to keep going.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_INTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 Not to mention the fact that entering the demilitarized zone is not good for PR.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_INTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 He thinks we should stop there. However, high-level instructions that we continue to follow up.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_INTRO_07|^2 Price: ^7 You will be dropped to the designated location.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_INTRO_08|^2 Price: ^7 Sneak into the chemical plant, check him out!
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_OUTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Ground communication shows that someone is giving orders to those mercenaries, but we do not know that person.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_OUTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 At the moment, we do not know what they are doing there.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_OUTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 Both come, then the security.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 Follow the plan and I will handle it.

VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_EVASION_OUTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 into position, ready to fight!
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 No one can find Huck, he disappeared.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_INTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 We will continue to find the reason.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_INTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 At the same time, the original order remained unchanged.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_INTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 The factory was heavily guarded and the mercenaries were well-equipped.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_INTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 The drone is about to arrive and you will get some air support.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_INTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 Sneak into the factory and find out exactly what the 115 elements are.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_OUTRO_01|^2 Ghost: ^7 Price, I'm a ghost - I have entered the factory.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_OUTRO_02|^2 Ghost: ^7 They are making chemical weapons here.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_OUTRO_03|^2 Ghost: ^7 These canisters are being shipped to a warehouse on the other side of the base.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_OUTRO_04|^2 ghost: ^7 soap, you take the couple to the warehouse. I am here to continue reconnaissance.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_OUTRO_05|^2 Soap: ^7 You heard - let's go.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Huck there is still no news.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_INTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 But we have a chance in front of us - it looks like the mercenaries are regrouping.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_INTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 Rushed to the warehouse immediately, opened the shady behind these chemical weapons.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 I have a piece of news, a bad news.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 No matter whether it is a mercenary or a worker, no one knows who is hiring them to work in the factory.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 It is clear that the job of a worker is to make the 115 element that Vasquez smuggled into a deadly poison called Nova 6.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 At the same time, we are not sure that this person in the video must be Huck.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 This does not make sense. But I believe my eyes.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 To be sure, these mercenary weaponry is by no means under us and is not soft on our own people.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_07|^2 Price: ^7 For Vasquez this loss of value of the mercenary, kill without pardon ...
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 All Listened - The Command believes the weapons of mass destruction here are extremely dangerous.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_INTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 They have to put a "bomb of the mother" to clear the market.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_INTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 That is to say, we have to get you out quickly.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_INTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 ghost, return to the squad, in the landing area with the new soap and meet!
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_INTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 I dispatched an "aerial gunboat" to pick it up. action!
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 The information you gathered shows that almost all of Novo 6's canisters are on the books ...
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 ... except one of them.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 Information shows that this Novo 6 gas tank has been shipped to the country of Pantal.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 That's right ... Bacard's rival.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 These two countries are already on the brink of war.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 Once the Nova 6 is deployed in Pantal, conflict between the two countries will surely escalate, and the entire region will confuse life.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_07|^2 Price: ^7 This is precisely the result of a well-planned, well-planned period by someone.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_08|^2 Price: ^7 Perhaps this man is Bacardi's sworn enemy; there is also the possibility that those who attacked us in the Warito are behindhand.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_09|^2 Price: ^7 But we have not had time to trace the masters behind the scenes.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_10|^2 Price: ^7 The current priority is to locate the missing Nova 6 and dismantle the bomb before it is detonated.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Huck has taken the bomb into the city and his men are preparing for the detonation.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_INTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 Once a bomb is detonated, civilian casualties will be immeasurable.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_INTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 You must arrive on the scene before Huck's detonator Nova 6.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_INTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 Set out immediately and win Huck!
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_OUTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Nice, young man.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_OUTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 But now Huck is going up to your position to set foot in for counterattack.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_OUTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 Check weapons and ammunition, ready to fight!
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 You have to keep soap and Nova 6 safe at all costs!
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Ghost, Soap, Newcomer - Huck is giving reinforcements to you - ready.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_02|^1 Huck: ^7 Do not toss, a few. Resistance is futile. You will be buried here.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_03|^1 Huck: ^7 What are their odds? how much do you have?
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_04|^1 Huck: ^7 I know your tactics. Textbook is what I wrote.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_05|^1 Huck: ^7 obediently surrender, man. Shadow Legion will -
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 Huck! Hand immediately! Or do not blame me you are welcome!
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_07|^2 Price: ^7 The outcome of the battle is hard to predict. We must be prepared.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_08|^2 Price: ^7 Deploy defense, guard Nova 6.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_09|^2 Price: ^7 Also, if you have the ability - get rid of that scum.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 The problem is that if the Shadow Legion forces so pervasive
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 So no one can predict how the situation will develop.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 Shadow Corps now temporarily suspended birds and animals.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 Probed to have escaped to their underground lair.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 However, one day, we'll find their lair.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 By that time, none of them wants to escape.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_07|^2 Price: ^7 By that time, we want to make them bloodthirsty ...
VIDSUBTITLES_CRASH_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Vazquez used Audran as a temporary base.
VIDSUBTITLES_CRASH_INTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 UAVs do support on our heads.
VIDSUBTITLES_CRASH_INTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 We wanted to dive into the town and to Vazquez's office looking for clues about the shipment.

VIDSUBTITLES_FAVELA_OUTRO_02|^2 Soap: ^7 He has been armed with a Cortez criminal group with military-grade weapons. In return, they helped him deliver the goods.
VIDSUBTITLES_FAVELA_OUTRO_03|^2 Ghost: ^7 The bastard knew we were here - Vazquez hid in his own mansion.
VIDSUBTITLES_FAVELA_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 Vazquez acts as an umbrella for the Cotzi criminal syndicate and it is not good news.
VIDSUBTITLES_FAVELA_OUTRO_05|^2 Ghost: ^7 Ortiz did not say much, but referred to the city of Audran.

VIDSUBTITLES_EVASION_PRI_00_01|^2 Price: ^7 Bakkha's diplomatic officials claim they have never had any contact with the Vazquez or the Kotais group.
VIDSUBTITLES_EVASION_PRI_00_02|^2 Price: ^7 They also said that the 115-element factory was not in the Bakkhas but in a "demilitarized zone" at the border with neighboring countries.
VIDSUBTITLES_EVASION_PRI_00_03|^2 Price: ^7 This is actually the demilitarized zone at the junction of the two countries
VIDSUBTITLES_EVASION_PRI_00_04|^2 Price: ^7 Colonel Huck, our commander, believes that this task will not yield any results, but the Central Command instructed us to sneak into the demilitarized zone
VIDSUBTITLES_EVASION_PRI_00_10|^2 Price: ^7 Huck ordered us to secretly observe, so we have to keep a low profile

VIDSUBTITLES_AC_PRI_00_03|^2 Price: ^7 An aerial gunboat will support you in intercepting bombs and stopping them.

VIDSUBTITLES_AC_PRI_20_02|^2 Price: ^7 We tracked the dirty bomb and found it in Pantal, where Huck took 115. His plan is unknown.
VIDSUBTITLES_AC_PRI_20_03|^2 Price: ^7 We can not give Huck the opportunity to use a dirty bomb to provoke a full-scale war between Bakhaha and Pantal.
VIDSUBTITLES_AC_PRI_20_04|^2 Price: ^7 Our primary goal is to intercept dirty bombs before detonating
VIDSUBTITLES_AC_PRI_20_06|^2 Price: ^7 There's an organization called the Fission Committee, and we now know they are efficient and cruel.
VIDSUBTITLES_AC_PRI_20_07|^2 Price: ^7 Their motivation seems to be to dominate the world, but we know almost nothing about them. They can not get dirty bombs at all costs.

VIDSUBTITLES_BRDG_PRI_12_02|^2 Price: ^7 We do not know who the bombs are in, but if Shadow is true, the Shadow Legion has already lost the bomb.
VIDSUBTITLES_BRDG_PRI_12_03|^2 Price: ^7 Our mission remains unchanged, capturing the bomb and ensuring it will not be detonated.
VIDSUBTITLES_BRDG_PRI_12_04|^2 Price: ^7 Follow Novo 6, no matter who control the bombs, give me kill!
VIDSUBTITLES_GS_PRI_01_01|^2 Price: ^7 We confirm that fission forces have captured the bomb and have entered the city.

VIDSUBTITLES_LS_HRKR_01_02|^2 Huck: ^7 Let our people get ready

VIDSUBTITLES_LS_HRKR_01_04|^2 Harker: ^7 We have to hold these important positions after the bombs are detonated, and in the unlikely event that the bombs are detonated, we can at least guarantee liaison
VIDSUBTITLES_LS_PRI_01_05|^2 Price: ^7 We lost contact with him, Shadow Legion troops have been out of combat
VIDSUBTITLES_LS_PRI_01_06|^2 Price: ^7 Ready to stick to the ground to protect Arthur, so that he can concentrate on the bomb.
VIDSUBTITLES_LS_ARCH_10_01|^2 Arthur: ^7 It's all my fault. . . Executive. . . I'm sorry everyone. . .
VIDSUBTITLES_LS_PRI_10_02|^2 Price: ^7 No! Shadow Corps unarmed, fissile forces can concentrate fully to regain the bomb.
VIDSUBTITLES_LS_ARCH_10_03|^2 Arthur: ^7 Price, Fissile Force remotely controls and detonates a bomb.
VIDSUBTITLES_LS_PRI_10_04|^2 Price: ^7 I wonder why Huck retreated midway, but let's focus first.
VIDSUBTITLES_LS_PRI_10_05|^2 Price: ^7 A lot of good soldiers are sacrificed. Your task is to ensure the safe evacuation of our remaining troops.
